This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

IMPORTANT:
    In order for the map and fairy to be displayed, you must update the pathways in the DisplayFairy and DisplayMap classes.
    After you download the image to your computer, find the file and press 'get info'. Copy and paste this pathway to replace the current pathway, which only works on my (Kavitha's) computer.

Key and command words in Candyland:
    Most common:
        'Quit': typing 'Quit' will end the game.
        'Roll': typing 'Roll' will continue the game and the dice will be rolled again.

    Rare/less common:
        'Yes': you will be asked to type yes or no in the case that you are a lollipop and you are on a trap square/ have not used your power yet.
        'Continue': this will continue the game instead of quitting it.
