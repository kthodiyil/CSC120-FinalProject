 KAVITHA'S REFLECTION

What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
    I started with the architecture diagrams to establish which classes and attributes I would need to code CandyLand sucessfully.
    I also found that creating a map of my game as one of the first moves was super helpful because then I was able to have a visual of
    where the traps and special squares would be.

What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    I had a great time experimenting with the image display code. This was a new way of displaying images that I had not used before and it was fun!

Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
    If I had more time, I would have liked to simplify some of the code inside of the Game class. I was mostly focused on making sure that the bounds of the game 
    were covered and that the game performed as needed, rather than efficiency, which is always a nice feature in programs.

If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
    I would absolutely LOVE to have some more fun with the map. I made it so pretty and I wish I could have made it a more important part of the project.
    When I used to play CandyLand as a kid the board design was one of my favorite parts. I also wish the game was less terminal based and had a more appealing interface.
    I am familiar working with interactive graphics and I wish that I had had the time to do that for this project.

What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    I did not receive any feedback throughout my process because I worked alone and did not consult anyone.

If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
    I would definetly say that I should have given myself more time to enjoy the process of crafting this game.
    I knew I always liked making games, but this project really made me love coding games because it is so fun.
    
    I also really want to code a system that automatically tests my code through some loops so that I do not have to 
    manually test my code.
